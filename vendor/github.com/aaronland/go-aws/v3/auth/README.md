# go-aws-auth

Go package providing methods and tools for determining or assigning AWS credentials.

## Credentials

Credentials for URIs are defined as string labels. They are:

| Label | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `anon:` | Empty or anonymous credentials. |
| `env:` | Read credentials from AWS defined environment variables. |
| `iam:` | Assume AWS IAM credentials are in effect. |
| `sts:{ARN}` | Assume the role defined by `{ARN}` using STS credentials. |
| `{AWS_PROFILE_NAME}` | This this profile from the default AWS credentials location. |
| `{AWS_CREDENTIALS_PATH}:{AWS_PROFILE_NAME}` | This this profile from a user-defined AWS credentials location. |

For example:

```
aws:///us-east-1?credentials=iam:
```
